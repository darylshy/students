Hello, my name is Daryl Shy. I'm a Senior at Lehman College. I'm a computer science major. Something interesting about me? 
I'm agorophobic, which for me means I fear wide open spaces. Which is why I love living in New York City, since everything
is so close together. My favorite food is :pizza:, which is another reason why I love this city. Best pizza in the world!
